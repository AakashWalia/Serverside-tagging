## Event Forwarding
Lets learn what event forwarding is before we learn how to configure a service in datastream. 

Event forwarding in Adobe Experience Platform allows you to send collected event data to a destination for server-side processing. Event forwarding decreases web page and app weight by using Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network to execute tasks normally done on the client. Implemented in a similar manner to tags, event forwarding rules can transform and send data to new destinations, but instead of sending this data from a client application like a web browser, it is sent from Adobeâ€™s servers.

1. **Select Event Forwarding:** Under event forwarding in your left hand panel, click on event forwarding.
